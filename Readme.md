What is this and how to use it？
- This is a Timer and battery calculator for Formula E Sim Racing
- It can help engineer to calculate the lower limit of battery of the car
- The upper three buttons are used to set the total racing time of the race
- The middle three buttons are used to set the time of for driving one lap by the driver
- The bottom three buttons are used to start, stop and reset the timer

Example:
Assume the total racing time is 1 second, the driver need 1 second to drive a lap.
When the timer is set and started, the battery status would be 100%.
After one second, which is the race ends, the battery status will drop to 50% since the driver need to drive one more lap after the end of the race.
When the driver finished his/her lap, the battery status will drop to 0%.
